# week11-Hangman

I've created a one-of-a-kind Node-based Hangman App using user input via the
Npm package "Inquirer" and for an added touch, I implemented a npm package called "figlet"
in witch created a Start, win, and lose ASCII-text. This project, was implimented using constructors functions, user input and objects.
